> AMM+ was inspired by founder TC Lewis and his strategy to invest in DeFi. It is a model that aims to replicate the process of identifying the highest yields in DeFi among preferred tokens automatically. The portfolio building logic revolves around filtering pools that match the token criteria and selecting the top 10 pools based on expected net returns to build the portfolio, seeking the maximum current yield while minimizing losses of impermanent loss.
